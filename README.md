Features:

The goal of the TeamNote app is to allow users to keep track of tasks and their progress. To support basic functionality, a basic CRUD scaffolding was used. There is one Note model, which contains string fields for the notes's title, description and priority. Users may create, update, and delete, and view a note. They can also view all existing notes on a page, or a Notepad. Each note is stored in a database and may be retrieved at any time. 

The user starts at a landing page that asks if she would like to view all existing notes, or create a new note. 

Other comments:

I used Bootstrap for styling. There are some outstanding styling issues, such as the spacing between buttons, but these will be fixed in the next iteration.
